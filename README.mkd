# ghost-docker 👻

A simple ghost deployment using docker-compose. 🐋

## setup 🔨

If you don't have Docker installed on your server, run the following:

```
./scripts/install-docker.sh
```

### production 🔥

Then simply run:
```
GHOST_URL=http://your-domain.com PORT=80 docker-compose up -d
```

This will serve ghost on port 80 on your server as a background process.

### development 🐢

```
docker-compose up
```

You can verify it is running properly by checking `http://localhost:8080` on your browser.
